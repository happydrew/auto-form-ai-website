# How to Autofill IRCTC Tatkal Forms: Speed Up Your Train Booking with AI

## Introduction: A Faster Way to Book Your Tatkal Tickets

Booking Tatkal tickets on the **IRCTC** website can be stressful, especially when you're trying to secure your seat during high-demand periods. With the ticketing process being fast-paced and time-sensitive, every second counts.

Imagine filling out the same information (such as your name, age, and travel details) repeatedly every time you book a Tatkal ticket. It’s tedious and can slow down your chances of getting a ticket. Fortunately, **AutoFormAI** has a solution.

With the **IRCTC autofill form tool** by **AutoFormAI**, you can quickly and accurately fill out your **IRCTC Tatkal form** in a matter of seconds, reducing your chances of missing out on available seats. In this article, we’ll show you how to use this powerful tool to autofill your Tatkal booking forms with ease.

## Why Should You Use an Autofill Extension for IRCTC Tatkal?

### 1. Speed Up the Tatkal Booking Process

Tatkal booking is all about speed. During peak times, IRCTC opens Tatkal booking for a limited number of seats, and tickets get booked within seconds. Manually entering your details can delay the process and reduce your chances of getting a ticket.

With **AutoFormAI**, you can instantly fill out your **IRCTC Tatkal form** with just one click. The tool pulls data from your **personal information library** (which can include your name, contact information, and other required details) and matches it to the corresponding fields on the IRCTC form.

### 2. No More Repeated Data Entry

If you frequently book train tickets, you know the frustration of entering the same information over and over again. With **IRCTC autofill chrome extension**, you can store your details once and reuse them across all future Tatkal bookings. This eliminates repetitive data entry and saves you precious time.

### 3. Accurate and Error-Free Form Filling

Manually typing in your details can lead to mistakes, especially under pressure when booking Tatkal tickets. The **AutoFormAI** extension ensures your details are populated correctly and consistently, reducing human error and increasing your chances of successful booking.
